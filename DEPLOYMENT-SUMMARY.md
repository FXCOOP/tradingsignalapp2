## 🔍 Monitoring & Analytics

### **Key Metrics to Track**

**Conversion Funnel:**
```
Page View → Popup View → Popup Engagement → CTA Click → Exness Redirect → Registration → FTD
```

**GA4 Events to Track:**
- `popup_view` (which popup, timestamp)
- `popup_close` (dismiss rate)
- `popup_cta_click` (conversion rate by popup)
- `broker_redirect` (click_id, device_type)
- `exness_registration` (from postback)
- `exness_ftd` (first-time deposit)

**Exness Dashboard:**
- Check click_id in conversion reports
- Match FTDs to original popup source
- Calculate ROI by popup type

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Countdown Timer**
- Currently starts at 09:47:00
- Resets on page refresh (intentional)
- Consider: Persist in localStorage to prevent gaming

### **Click ID Tracking**
- Stored in `exness_clicks` table
- Links to user_id, device_type, click_source
- Enables full attribution chain

### **Mobile Detection**
- Uses user agent regex
- Covers: Android, iOS, iPad, BlackBerry, etc.
- Falls back to desktop URL if detection fails

### **Popup Frequency**
- Currently shows every page load
- Consider: Add localStorage to limit frequency
- Recommended: Show max 1x per 24 hours per visitor
