# Render Deployment Status

## Issue Detected: Oct 20, 2025

### Errors in Production (Render):
```
POST https://tradingsignalapp.onrender.com/api/track/signal 404 (Not Found)
POST https://tradingsignalapp.onrender.com/api/track/article 404 (Not Found)
```

### Root Cause:
The API endpoints exist in the codebase (committed in b8799e7) but Render hasn't redeployed since that commit.

### Solution:
1. Trigger manual redeploy on Render dashboard
2. OR this commit will trigger auto-deploy (if enabled)

### API Endpoints That Should Exist:
- ✅ `/api/track/signal` - Track signal clicks (FREE tier)
- ✅ `/api/track/article` - Track article views (FREE tier)
- ✅ `/api/track/exness-click` - Track Exness affiliate clicks
- ✅ `/api/postback/exness` - Receive Exness conversion postbacks

### React Errors (#425, #418, #423):
These are hydration errors that occur in production. They're warnings and don't break functionality, but we should monitor them.

Common causes:
- Server/client HTML mismatch
- Dynamic content rendering differences
- Styled-jsx issues (already fixed in AuthModal)

### Checklist:
- [ ] Verify Render auto-deploy is enabled
- [ ] Check Render build logs for errors
- [ ] Test API endpoints after deployment
- [ ] Monitor React errors in browser console

### Test Commands After Deployment:
```bash
# Test signal tracking (should return 401 if not authenticated)
curl -X POST https://tradingsignalapp.onrender.com/api/track/signal

# Test article tracking (should return 401 if not authenticated)
curl -X POST https://tradingsignalapp.onrender.com/api/track/article

# Test postback endpoint (should return 200 with operational status)
curl https://tradingsignalapp.onrender.com/api/postback/exness
```

### Expected After Deployment:
- API endpoints should return proper errors (401, not 404)
- React errors should be minimal
- Free tier tracking should work correctly
